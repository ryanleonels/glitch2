It will do the same, but in different ways depending on the Delta Time.</li>
	  <li>The game will continue to run in another tab. This is also caused by the implementation of Delta Timing, and thus is natural.</li>

	  <ul>
	  <li>It is supposed to be fixed along with Incrementyverse update, since it is very easy to fix, so Patcail push a hotfix at 2 weeks before Incrementyverse out.</li>

		<li>Fixed a bug where in Challenge 9, the Incrementy Production display isn't divided by 1e15.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug where OC6 reward can affect Challenge 9 debuff and update rate, making Incrementy increase slower than normal.</li>
