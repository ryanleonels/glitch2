              While Incremental Ordinals <em>might</em> run without major issues
              in older browser versions, we do not actively test Incremental
              Ordinals in them and generally do not fix bugs that may appear in
              them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, Incremental Ordinals does not fix bugs in pre-release
              versions of browsers, such as beta or dev releases. If you find a
              bug with Incremental Ordinals in a pre-release of a browser, you
              should report the bug to the browser vendor.

            The Basics
          </h1>
          <p>
            When you start this game, you should see a number in the form of
            H<sub>ordinal</sub> (10). You can click a button to increase the
            ordinal by 1. The number should go up. When your number reaches 20,
            you can maximize the ordinal. Your ordinal will increase to ω,
            pronounced <i>omega</i>. Omega is the first infinite ordinal. After
            ω you can increase the ordinal even more, but the number goes up
            faster. At ω+10, you can maximize to ω2. ω2+10 maximizes to ω3 and
            so on. You can also maximize at ordinals like ω+20 → ω2+5 and ω3+100
            → ω6+3. At ω9+10, you can maximize to ω<sup>2</sup>, which is omega
            multiplied by itself. Your number reaches 10240, and you can now
            Infinity!

              Infinity
            </h2>
            <p>
              When you Infinity, you reset your ordinal, but you gain Ordinal
              Points (OP) based on your ordinal. You can spend your OP on
              autoclickers and factors.

              <p>
                Autoclickers automate your progress. You can automate adding 1
                to the ordinal or maximizing the ordinal. They both cost OP.

                Factors multiply your autoclicker speed! They cost OP to
                upgrade. You start with zero factors, but you can do Factor
                Shifts to gain factors.

                When you reach the required OP, you can do a Factor Shift. It
                will reset everything before it, but you gain a new factor and
                your base decreases by 1. Bases are ways to reach larger
                ordinals from smaller ordinals. For example, at base 10, ω<sup
                  >3</sup
                >
                requires ω<sup>2</sup>9+ω9+10. In base 4, you only need
                ω<sup>2</sup>3+ω3+4, and at very low bases, bases can be quite
                overpowered. You can turn ω<sup>2</sup>2+ω2+3 into ω<sup>ω</sup>
                in base 3!

                Boosters. In order to gain Manifolds, you must sacrifice
                Incrementy. Manifolds make the Dynamic Factor grow faster based

                are also 6 new Incrementy Upgrades that have been added. They

              pronounced “Aleph”. Each of the Alephs produce Aleph Power, which
              gives a boost on its own. The multiplier is log<sub>10</sub>(Aleph
              Power+10) for all three of the Alephs. However, they boost
              different things. I suggest you do ℵ<sub>1</sub> for your first

                When you complete all of the sluggish milestones, you get
                rewarded with a ton of QoL features. For example, you can
                autocomplete challenges when you’re in them. You can keep your
                Incrementy and Decrementy upgrades. You unlock autoprestigers.
                You can complete challenge 8 more times! (From 3 to Infinite),
                but most importantly, you unlock two more rows of Booster
                Upgrades. They act as normal booster upgrades but are much more
                expensive.

              <p>
                Singularity is a mechanic that requires 5e11 Boosters, or a
                million Factor Boosts! When unlocked, you can sacrifice your
                Manifolds, Dark Manifolds, and ℵ<sub>ω</sub> for Singularity
                Levels. Singularity Levels raise the Factor Boost requirement,
                but you get more Factor Boosts when you complete them! You can
                also downgrade the singularity for Manifolds.

                Singularity Functions are a mechanic that unlock when you reach
                a level 20 Singularity. Singularity Function upgrades cost
                Functions which are based on your Singularity Level. They are
                often very powerful. When you buy the 9th Singularity Function,
                you unlock the Baseless Milestones.

                Baseless Milestones are milestones that unlock when you reach
                the required ordinal in Challenge 4. They give rewards that make
                the game more convenient. The first one requires
                ω<sup>ω<sup>2</sup>3</sup>, and it gives you one Refund Point
                every second. Each Baseless Milestone also gives you free
                permanent Boosters to spend on Upgrades. The Baseless Milestones
                let you skip the later parts of Collapse.

                Fractal Shifts are a mechanic that unlock when you reach
                10↑↑10000 Incrementy. Fractal Shifting will reset all of your
                previous progress, but you get a new Fractal Engine and the
                Fractal Base decreases by 1. Fractal Bases decrease the Fractal
                Engine cost to 10{level}base. While this will have very little
                effect for the first few Fractal Shifts, it will become
                noticeable once you have enough Fractal Shifts. The Fractal
                Shift cost is 10{shifts+2}1000 Incrementy.

                When you perform a Fractal Shift for the first time, you unlock

                Fractal Engine speed. The formula for E-Factor Shifts is
                2√(Fractal Shifts)-1, where the value is rounded down. The
