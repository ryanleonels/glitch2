        How to play Scrap 2 Fanmade
      </h1>
      <p>
        You start off as 0 Scrap.
        <br>
        To merge a barrel, you need 2 of the same barrel at once
        <br>
        Trying to merge Circle Blue with Square Pink won't work
        <br>
        In this modded Scrap 2 Fanmade, the multiplier for barrels goes
        <br>
        up by x2.75, not the usual x3. So gameplay will be slower
        <br>
        A currency is introduced, Legendary Scrap, but we will talk
        <br>
        about that later.
        <br>
        Once you reach 1 Quintillion Scrap (1 Qi) you can prestige.
        <br>
        Prestiging is worth Golden Scrap, but you'll lose all your Scrap
        <br>
        upgrades, and the Golden Scrap will give you extra Scrap boosts.
        <br>
        You can later buy upgrades with Golden Scrap, including Get More
        <br>
        Scrap, and Get More Magnets.
        <br>
        You also have 2 Scrap Upgrades for Faster Barrels and Better
        <br>
        Barrels. Faster Barrels basically makes the barrels spawn faster.
        <br>
        The Faster Barrels can become supersonic speed if you're far in
        <br>
        game, but you will not be able to keep up with that speed
        <br>
        anyways :)
        <br>
        Better Barrels is an even better upgrade than Faster Barrels.
        <br>
        This upgrade makes barrels spawn at higher tiers once
        <br>
        upgraded, a key to progressing in this game.
        <br>
        Scrap Upgrades are required to progress in this game, it is
        <br>
        the main currency here, and in every Scrap Game.
        <br>
        You even have Magnet Upgrades, Get More Scrap, Get More
        <br>
        Golden Scrap, and Increased Chance to get Magnets while
        <br>
        merging. Other Magnet Upgrades like Faster Auto Merge
        <br>
        Speed and Faster Brick Production will be unlocked later
        <br>
        in the game.
        <br>
        <br>
        Upgrades and their effects
        <br>
        The Golden Scrap Upgrade 'Get More Magnets' gives a small
        <br>
        magnet boost once upgraded. Get More Scrap will deeply
        <br>
        increase Scrap Production in early game.
        <br>
        As Golden Scrap upgrades start getting more expensive
        <br>
        in post-early game, you start gaining extra Golden Scrap
        <br>
        from having so much Scrap.
        <br>
        Magnet Upgrades are good if you don't want to waste Scrap
        <br>
        Production, Get More Scrap gains less boost than in the
        <br>
        Golden Scrap Upgrade itself. Get More Golden Scrap
        <br>
        is good in early game, even better in post-early game!
        <br>
        Very early in the game you have access to Legendary Scrap.
        <br>
        Legendary Scrap will cost you your Golden Scrap, and you
        <br>
        will get only 1 Legendary Scrap once pressed.
        <br>
        There is currently only 1 Legendary Scrap upgrade, that is
        <br>
        Higher Barrel Power. It increases the barrel multiplier by 0.01.
        <br>
        This upgrade will make progress a lot faster in late game
        <br>
        There might be more Legendary Scrap Upgrades very soon!
        <br>
        Also watch out from older versions of this mod when importing
        <br>
        the save code, the 'NaN' bug will occur with Scrap.
        <br>
        'NaN' is not good because it disables the option to have
        <br>
        Scrap, or any form of currency in this game. If you see 'NaN',
        <br>
        please tell the developer of this mod to fix your save code.
        <br>
        You will unlock the Solar System at the 8th Get More Scrap
        <br>
        Golden Scrap upgrade. This will make progress better again.
        <br>
        <br>
        All about the Solar System
        <br>
        There is 9 different planets. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
        <br>
        Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. You might remember this
        <br>
        growing up in school.
        <br>
        In Scrap 2 Fanmade, these 9 planets are worth certain upgrades.
        <br>
        The Sun is the first one you'll start out with, every upgrade
        <br>
        gives an extra Scrap Boost.
        <br>
        Mercury gives an extra 1% Golden Scrap Boost every upgrade.
        <br>
        Venus gives an extra chance to spawn double barrels, goes to 50%
        <br>
        Earth is our home planet, every important feature is unlocked
        <br>
        here.
        <br>
        At 100,000 Golden Scrap, you can buy the 'Buy Max' feature.
        <br>
        As you get 250 Billion Golden Scrap (250 B), you will unlock
        <br>
        Mars, and so on.
        <br>
        Mars decreases the time you need to wait for a Magnet to fall
        <br>
        from the sky.
        <br>
        Jupiter decreases the cost of all Magnet Upgrades (Except Sun
        <br>
        Upgrades)
        <br>
        Saturn makes Auto Merge faster.
        <br>
        Uranus greatly increases Scrap Production from Merge Mastery,
        <br>
        especially if there is a lot of levels on it!
        <br>
        Neptune gives a passive Magnet Boost, but it's very slow.
        <br>
        Other currencies are accessible through the Solar System.
        <br>
        In SC2FMFR there is more planets.
        <br>
        <br>
        All about Merge Quests
        <br>
        You will unlock Merge Quests at (1 Tg) Scrap.
        <br>
        The amount of merges will vary depending on the quest.
        <br>
        The merge requirements can be 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500,
        <br>
        and 5000. Higher the merges = More Merge Tokens.
        <br>
        All Merge Quests will have a certain barrel you have to
        <br>
        merge. It is inbetween the 75 highest barrels you've
        <br>
        reached in your gameplay.
        <br>
        Once you have Merge Tokens, you can buy Get More Scrap,
        <br>
        Get More Golden Scrap, Get More Magnets, and more.
        <br>
        The amount of merges it takes to finish a Merge Quest
        <br>
        will go down if you buy 'Complete and refresh Merge
        <br>
        Quests faster' upgrade.
        <br>
        Merge Tokens are later used in the Skill Tree.
        <br>
        <br>
        All about Auto Merging
        <br>
        You will unlock Auto Merge at 1000 Golden Scrap.
        <br>
        With Auto Merge you can go AFK and progress in the game
        <br>
        Once you first unlock Auto Merging it will be very slow
        <br>
        but it can be upgraded in a few different ways
        <br>
        Auto Merging Speed can be upgraded through Magnets,
        <br>
        Saturn, or Tires.
        <br>
        The max level for Faster Auto Merge Speed in the
        <br>
        original SC2FM was 250%. Here it's 350%!
        <br>
        Warning: Auto Merge may mess up your merging pattern,
        <br>
        be careful!
        <br>
        <br>
        All about Falling Items
        <br>
        Certain Items like Magnets, Steel Beams, and Tires will
        <br>
        fall from the top periodically. Collect them.
        <br>
        (They won't fall if you don't have those unlocked yet)
        <br>
        Once you collect Falling Items, you will get a reward for
        <br>
        whatever currency it is.
        <br>
        <br>
        All about Merge Mastery
        <br>
        Merge Mastery is unlocked at 1 Qig Scrap.
        <br>
        Once you merge, the merges bar will count up towards the
        <br>
        max, and once you get a new level, you will get Magnets,
        <br>
        and extra Scrap Income.
        <br>
        You can prestige Merge Mastery after level 50. You will get
        <br>
        an extra Golden Scrap and Magnet Boost, but you will lose
        <br>
        your Scrap Production.
        <br>
        Keep in mind if you prestige with a strong Scrap Multiplier,
        <br>
        your Scrap Production will go to a halt until you get your
        <br>
        boosts back.
        <br>
        This Merge Mastery thing is like what you'll see in Scrap
        <br>
        Clicker 2, but basically you can merge any barrel you want.
        <br>
        Mastery Tokens wlll be added very very soon!
        <br>
        <br>
        All about Bricks
        <br>
        Bricks are unlocked at 1 Sxg Scrap.
        <br>
        You start out as 0 bricks
