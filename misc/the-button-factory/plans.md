i am trying to type here
1. clicks and autoclickers synergize with each other
2. first tier autoclickers gain a multiplier based on the amount of first tier autoclickers (scaled)
3. super autoclickers gain a multiplier based on the amount of super autoclickers (scaled)
4. hyper autoclickers gain a multiplier based on the amount of first and second tier autoclickers (superscaled)
5. for each manually purchased autoclickers of each type, it becomes 2.5% more powerful 

=== OVERCLOCK ERA ===
you unlock a new qol feature in this era (second button)
you also unlock shapes
6. first tier autobuyers gain a multiplier based on the total amount of jolts gained
7. your current amount of jolts increase the clicking power
8. upgrade 1 becomes more powerful based on your jolts
9. ???
10. maybe placeholder

second button will automatically generate chroma/hue over time
this can create mini buttons for you (provided you have the material to get it)
you get material from the outside world (generated from searching)
mini buttons will automate features that you already can do yourself
the second button can also be upgraded with material (material will be generated)

shapes are unlocked by getting enough chroma/hue
you can eventually create a button that has more sides and is more like a circle
each side will cost points which make the button more powerful
after getting a 10 sided polygon you can unlock more features, even more at 100 sides and so on.

maybe this is all i have for now

# this never really happened, hopefully this game may get remastered in 2024
