# rpg-dimensions

Let's put ideas hereeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

# Attacking

- you should be able to attack dimensions. dimensions may die, but some will surrender at the point of death and unlock a new feature
- dimension numbers determine strength and health of dimension (so dimension 5 is more powerful than dimension 2)
- you get exp when a dimension dies

# Defending

- you can unlock abilities
- it also reduces damage taken to you

# Looks

- round borders for buttons
- good UI
- font will be [insert font here]

# Shop

- you can use exp to buy stuff from the shop 
- the shop has random items & upgrades

# Coding rules
- don't make a different file for literally everything
- don't put scripts directly in the html file
- comment some of it to make it less confusing
- rewind if you mess up badly
- make sure the cpu, memory, and disk are at a safe number
